Usage information for bci

BCI will be used to build projects as they are committed in git

commands:
	bci proj add <name> /path/to/home/for/proj
		create a bci project named <name> that will live in /path/to/home/for/proj
	bci proj -d <name>
		delete the project named <name>
	bci proj config <name> <prop-name> <prop-value>
		set config option for a bci project named <name>


installation:
	set up a place for bci to store it's stuff
	config options, and default location for project homes
		BCI_HOME="$HOME/.bci"
		mkdir -p "$BCI_HOME"
	BCI scripts and binaries will install to $BCI_HOME/bin
	which should be added to your $PATH variable

project creation:
	the only thing bci requires to create a new project is a location to git clone from
	additionally, users may specify a project name and project home directory
	if no name is given, bci will use the name of the git repository
	if no project home is given, bci will default to $BCI_HOME/projects/<project_name>

	information about all bci projects will be stored in $BCI_HOME/config

project organization:
	$PROJ_HOME will contain three items:
		$PROJ_HOME/config: (file)
			this is where all configuration options for bci_proj will live for this specific project
			including file rotation config options for data (how many builds to keep)
		$PROJ_HOME/repo: (directory)
			this is where the project itself is checked out. when the project is first created,
			specify a remote location to git clone from
			run git clone <remote> $PROJ_HOME/repo
		$PROJ_HOME/data: (directory)
			this is where bci will store data relate to previous builds of the project
			this includes error logs, build information, test outputs, etc.

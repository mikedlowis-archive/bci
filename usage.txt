	config options, and default location for project homes
		BCI_HOME="$HOME/.bci"

project organization:
	when you create a project, it must have the following:
		a location to git clone from (required)
		a project name (optional)
			derrivable from the git clone location
		a project home (optional) ($PROJ_HOME)
			by default PROJ_HOME will be $BCI_HOME/projects/<project_name>
	$PROJ_HOME will contain three directories:
		$PROJ_HOME/config:
			this is where all configuration options for bci_proj will live for this specific project
			including file rotation config options for data (how many builds to keep)
		$PROJ_HOME/repo:
			this is where the project itself is checked out. when the project is first created,
			specify a remote location to git clone from
			run git clone <remote> $PROJ_HOME/repo
		$PROJ_HOME/data:
			this is where bci will store data relate to previous builds of the project
			this includes error logs, build information, test outputs, etc.
